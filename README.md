## 1. Introduction
The purpose of this project is to build a model capable of recognizing handwritten digits from images. This is a typical image classification task and is widely used as a benchmark in the field of computer vision and deep learning.

## 2. Requirements
The following Python libraries are required to run the notebook:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (depending on the model used)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- Pandas

Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn pandas tensorflow
```

## 3. Dataset
The MNIST dataset is used for training and testing the model. It consists of:

60,000 training images
10,000 test images
The dataset will be loaded via TensorFlow or Keras, and images will be normalized for better model performance.

## 4. Model Architecture
The CNN consists of the following layers:

Convolutional Layer: 16 filters, 3x3 kernel
MaxPooling Layer: 2x2 pool size
Dropout Layer: Dropout rate of 0.25
Flatten Layer
Dense Layers: 512 and 1024 units with ReLU activation
Output Layer: 10 units with softmax activation

## 5. Training and Evaluation
The model is trained on the training set, and its performance is evaluated on the test set. During training, the loss and accuracy are monitored. The trained model achieves high accuracy on the MNIST dataset, making it suitable for digit recognition tasks.

## 6. Usage
Open the notebook and run all cells sequentially.
Ensure that the dataset is downloaded and loaded properly.
Use the trained model to predict digits from input images (28x28 grayscale).
